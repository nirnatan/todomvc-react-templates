# TodoMVC-React-Templates

This React example integrates React-Templates for its views. It uses requireJs to get the view templates and render it in the equivalent react component. Note that after compiling the rt files it's pure React code that runs in the browser; The main React example uses a simple, custom immutable model.

> React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Its core principles are declarative code, efficiency, and flexibility. Simply specify what your component looks like and React will keep it up-to-date when the underlying data changes.
